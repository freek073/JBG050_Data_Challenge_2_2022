# JBG050_Data_Challenge_2_2022
## How to use the dashboard:

The files with the data required to run the dashboard are the provided dataset and
files contained in the folder "additional datasets" which can be found in this repository.
To get the msoa.geojson file, please use the attached download link. The size of this file is too
large to be uploaded to GitHub. Save the file as "msoa.geojson".

Thet should be added to the unzipped folder "DC2 dashboard", into a separate folder named "files".
The structure should be the following: \DC2 Dashboard\files\.

Alternatively, the following link can be used to download the scripts with all the filed included:

Then, a virtual environment should be set up and the main2.py script should be run.
The returned link allows to access the dashboard in one's browser.
