# JBG050_Data_Challenge_2_2022
## How to use the dashboard:

The files with the data required to run the dashboard are the provided dataset and
files contained in the folder "additional datasets" which can be found in this repository.

Both should be added to the unzipped folder "DC2 dashboard", into a separate folder named "files".
The structure should be the following: \DC2 Dashboard\files\.

Alternatively, the following link can be used to download the scripts with all the filed included:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RrJm-jq4MVmAe77Vo2bRNVsF8ErZFplV/view?usp=sharing

Then, a virtual environment should be set up and the main2.py script should be run.
The returned link allows to access the dashboard in one's browser.
